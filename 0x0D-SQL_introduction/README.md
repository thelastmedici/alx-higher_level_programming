# 0x0D-SQL_introduction

This repository contains the solutions to the SQL introduction tasks of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum.

## Description

In this project, we explore the basics of SQL (Structured Query Language) and its usage in managing relational databases. The tasks cover various concepts such as creating databases, tables, and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of SQL and relational databases
- Learn how to create and manage databases and tables
- Perform CRUD operations on the data using SQL queries
- Gain hands-on experience with SQL through practical exercises

## Files

The following files are included in this repository:

- `0-list_databases.sql`: A SQL script that lists all databases in the MySQL server.
- `1-create_database_if_missing.sql`: A SQL script that creates a new database if it doesn't already exist.
- `2-remove_database.sql`: A SQL script that removes a database from the MySQL server.
- `3-list_tables.sql`: A SQL script that lists all tables in a given database.
- `4-first_table.sql`: A SQL script that creates a new table in a given database.
- `5-full_table.sql`: A SQL script that prints the full description of a table.
- `6-list_values.sql`: A SQL script that lists all rows of a table.
- `7-insert_value.sql`: A SQL script that inserts a new row into a table.
- `8-count_89.sql`: A SQL script that displays the number of records with a specific condition.
- `9-full_creation.sql`: A SQL script that creates a new table with specific columns and constraints.

## Usage

To run the SQL scripts, you can use a MySQL client or any other tool that supports executing SQL queries. Simply open the desired script file and execute the queries against your MySQL server.
